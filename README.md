===================

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Open Science Training Initiative!

**** PLEASE NOTE: Uploads currently in progress. Keep checking back for new materials ****

The Open Science Training Initiative (OSTI) provides a series of lectures on topics in data management and open science, designed to sit over existing taught courses in any area of the sciences. All course materials carry a CC-BY licence, so you're free to take the slides (or indeed a subset of them) and modify them to suit your own requirements, as long as you provide an attribution to the original authors.

Brief descriptions of the course materials will appear below as files are added to this repo. If you have any questions about OSTI or the materials supplied here (i.e. not queries relating to the use of, or problems with, GitHub), please email *enquiries[at]opensciencetraining.com*

CORE LECTURES:
--------------
1. *Introduction: Reproducibility and Open Science*
(Divided into two sets of lecture slides: 1A introduces the themes of openness and reproducibility, while 1B explains how Rotation Based Learning works.)

- `Lecture1B:RotationOutline` is a slide deck for the second half of the opening lecture and is supplied in both .ODP and .PPTX formats. These slides assist the lecturer in explaining how Rotation Based Learning works; ready-formatted slides are included for listing of student work groups, lecture times and deadlines.

- `ExampleRotationHandout` is a text document handout intended as a handout for the OSTI student cohort; it is supplied in two formats: .ODT and .DOCX. Although the version supplied refers to GitHub, this is by no means an essential and course leaders may choose to use their preferred project hoster.

2. *Code, Content and Data Licensing*

3. *Open Access Publishing*

ENHANCEMENT LECTURES and/or PRACTICAL SEMINARS:
------------------------------------------------
4. *Version Control*

5. *Data Management Plans*

6. *The Work of the Open Knowledge Foundation*
