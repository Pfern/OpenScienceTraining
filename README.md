Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Open Science Training Initiative!

**** PLEASE NOTE: This repo is currently awaiting materials uploads. Course materials are in the later stages of preparation and will be appearing here during April 2013 ****

The Open Science Training Initiative (OSTI) provides a series of lectures on topics in data management and open science, designed to sit over existing taught courses in any area of the sciences. All course materials carry a CC-BY licence, so you're free to take the slides (or indeed a subset of them) and modify them to suit your own requirements, as long as you provide an attribution to the original authors.
