===================

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Open Science Training Initiative!

**** PLEASE NOTE: This repo is currently awaiting materials uploads. Course materials are in the later stages of preparation and will be appearing here during April/May 2013 ****

The Open Science Training Initiative (OSTI) provides a series of lectures on topics in data management and open science, designed to sit over existing taught courses in any area of the sciences. All course materials carry a CC-BY licence, so you're free to take the slides (or indeed a subset of them) and modify them to suit your own requirements, as long as you provide an attribution to the original authors.

Course materials scheduled for May 2013 release are as follows:

1. Introduction: Reproducibility and Open Science

2. Code, Content and Data Licensing

ENHANCEMENT LECTURES and/or PRACTICAL SEMINARS:
